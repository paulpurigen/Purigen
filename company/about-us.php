                        <p>
                                Purigen Biosystems' transformative Ionic Purification System provides a hands-free solution for extracting, enriching and quantifying DNA and RNA from biological samples. Our proprietary approach uses isotachophoresis (ITP), an electric-field-driven technique for purifying, focusing, and/or separating species.
                                The application of ITP to purify and quantify nucleic acids from complex biological samples was pioneered by Purigen co-founder, Stanford Professor Juan G. Santiago. The Ionic Purification System is compatible with a range of samples including cells and FFPE.

                        Dr. Bill Colston was previously the CEO and scientific founder of QuantaLife Inc., a successful biotechnology startup company. QuantaLife developed the most accurate genetic analysis system in the world, now sold internationally (droplet digital PCR™). Dr. Colston raised multiple rounds of private funding, moving from concept to manufactured product in a fraction of the time of comparable companies in this space. QuantaLife grew exponentially during his tenure, from the four scientific founders during the inception in 2008 to over sixty employees by the time it was sold to BioRad in 2011. Prior to QuantaLife, Dr. Colston worked within the University of California (UC) National Labs for almost 20 years, ultimately serving in multiple different senior leadership roles. A prolific scientific writer and inventor, he has authored numerous publications and patents. Dr. Colston received his BS in biology from the University of Texas, Austin, in 1989 and his Ph.D. in biomedical engineering from the University of California, Davis, in 1997.</span>
