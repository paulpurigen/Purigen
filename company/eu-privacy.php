                            <h3>GENERAL STATEMENT</h3>
                            <p>As of May 25, 2018, European Union Regulation 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (“EU GDPR”), requires us as the data controller of the Website to provide additional and different information about our data processing practices to data subjects in the European Economic Area (“EEA”).</p>

                            <p><em>Cookies.</em> With respect to web cookies and similar technologies that are not strictly necessary for our provision of the Website, Purigen seeks consent from users of the Service in the EEA based on a separate Cookies Policy.</p>

                            <p>Legal Basis of Processing. The legal basis for Purigen’s processing of your personal data in connection with our Website is Article 6(1)(b) of the EU GDPR, which allows processing of personal data as necessary for the performance of a contract. When you access, use or register for our events, services, you form a contract with Purigen based on the applicable terms of service, and we need to process your personal data to respond to your requests, provide communications and satisfy our obligations with respect to the other purposes listed in the Privacy Policy above.</p>

                            <p>Purigen also relies on your consent with respect to cookies that are not strict necessary and direct marketing emails per Article 6(1)(a) of the EU GDPR; and pursues legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the EU GDPR with respect to situations where Purigen needs to process your personal data to comply with applicable laws (as a U.S.-based company, Purigen Biosystems Inc. is subject to U.S. laws and must comply with them), provide good customer service, or improve our products and services. In these cases, we will ensure that your privacy and other fundamental interests do not override our legitimate interests.</p>

                            <p>Personal Data Transfers outside of the EEA. Purigen transmits some of your personal data to the following countries where the data protection laws may not provide a level of protection equivalent to the laws in your jurisdiction. As required by applicable law, Purigen will provide an adequate level of protection for your personal data using various means, including, where appropriate:</p>

                            <ul>
                                    <li>Relying on a formal decision by the European Commission that a certain country ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data (a full list of such decisions may be accessed online here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm), pursuant to Article 45 of the EU GDPR;</li>
                                    <li>Implementing appropriate physical, technical, and organizational security measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and against all other unlawful forms of processing; and</li>
                                    <li>Taking other measures to provide an adequate level of data protection in accordance with applicable law.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Data Subject Rights. You have a right to request from Purigen access to and rectification or erasure of your personal data. You also have the right to request the restriction of processing concerning you, in which case such personal data would be marked and processed by us only for certain purposes. In addition, you have the right to data portability, which allows you to receive from us personal data about you which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and the right to transmit such personal data to another entity without hindrance from us.</p>

                            <p>You also have the right to object to various data processing activities, including processing activities that are based exclusively on your consent or processing for the purposes of direct marketing. You can exercise such rights by accessing the information in your account and/or by emailing webmaster@purigenbio.com.

                            <p>If you have provided consent for cookies that are not strictly necessary or other data processing, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>

                            <p>Your Choices. You are not required to provide any personal data to Purigen, but if you do not provide any personal data to Purigen, you may not be able to use our Website or conduct business with us effectively. You can use our Website without consenting to cookies that are not strictly necessary; the only consequence is that our Online Services will be less tailored to you.</p>
